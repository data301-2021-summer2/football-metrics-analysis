The nail-biting ending of the Euro Final reminded us why football is known as the beautiful game. We both are football fanatics and we chose a football dataset to help us understand the game better. We found the dataset on Kaggle and the data is owned by understat.com. The dataset contains statistical summary data of each season from 2014 to 2019 for 5 UEFA Leagues: La Liga, EPL, BundesLiga, Serie A, Ligue 1. The dataset includes standard parameters such as team standings, amount of matches played, wins, draws and other additional metrics such as xG(expected goals) , xG_diff(difference between actual goals and expected goals), ppda_coef(passes allowed per defensive action), oppda_coef(passes allowed per defensive action in the opposition half). According to understat these metrics were collected by forming neural network prediction algorithms with large dataset.
